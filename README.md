Woodmart theme was used to develop the page. The theme allows you to quickly create the website with custom elements. Everything on the page is custom and I feel like the theme has modern tools to deliver anytime of website.
Plugins used : Yoast, WPFORMS, woodmart core plugins, wpbakery ( I could have used elementor , but wpbakery is more handy when it comes to layouts .) 
I used Revslider to just for a nice feel when welcoming any audiences , they will be already engaged and scrolling.
